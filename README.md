# DeepSLAM

Replicating [Convolutional Neural Network-based Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1509) for STAT946.

The dataset is the Eynsham dataset from the Oxford Mobile Robotics group. It doesn't appear to be anywhere on the
Internet anymore. I have a personal copy, but see [issue #3](https://github.com/Seanny123/DeepSLAM/issues/3)
for a disucssion of the problem.

All the `.h5` files were personal results created from Caffe outputs. They're probably horribly outdated. Ideally,
I should upload an example file, but first I have to clean up the code...
